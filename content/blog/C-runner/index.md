### This project recap is in progress
It's more of a planing and draft document

### Todos

- [ ] Get c to run in a web page
- [ ] Output that to a buffer window
- [ ] Make generic way to port standard C programs to run in the web Posix



So my basic idea is to make a nice looking C runner that would take stdout and output it to a html element

Then add some styling and cool fonts to make it look fancy.

The main thing that would make this make this a success would be able to have the ablility to drop in a basic c project with a main and everthing and have it work seamlessly

So I'd be able to have directory with my projects and let anybody run them and see the output.

So having compile in browser would be cool
